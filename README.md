# Overview

Farkle is a push-your-luck dice game that has many different variations. Players roll dice and get points based on the combinations that those dice make. If a player rolls and none of the dice make a combination then that player "farkles" and their turn is over and the points they lose the points they accumulated during the turn.

This version of the game is based on our favorite rules. The score of each combination is based on the most common way to play. However, we have added less common rules such as "Roll Previous" where you can build on the previous player's score if you are lucky and "Last Chance" where the game lasts for one more round after the first player reaches 10,000 points. We think these additional rules add some more strategy to the game.

# Design

This web app is designed by Noah and Tim. This is both our first fully functional web app and was made to test our knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We also wanted to learn a little of what the team design process was like and learn new skills during the building of the website.

While the web app is functional we still intend to add other small features and styling.

### Notes

Still need to add winning condition.
